# Independent Project Proposal: Visualizing Social Media Data

## Data
The data I propose to visualize is from my [Social Media MQP](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/flanagancarlie/985c6e920016a7e0039d5105cc4fdb22/raw/9213b64f32e1ba5d076a96c9307a0be9de143f84/mqp_data.csv).

## Prototypes


## Questions & Tasks
I want to visualize the perception of twelve social media with relation to use demographics. The demographics include age, race, gender and whether the user identifies as LGBT. The twelve social media are BeReal, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitch, Twitter, YouTube and 4chan.
